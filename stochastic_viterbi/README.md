# Stochastic Viterbi

The goal of this algorithm is to find multiple, likely paths through a hidden Markov model. The algorithm is based on the Viterbi algorithm, but instead of finding the most likely path, it finds the `n` most likely paths. Probabilities of being in a state are calculated using a forward-backward algorithm.
